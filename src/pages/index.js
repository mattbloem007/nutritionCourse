          <p>
            In the pursuit of embodiment, one of the fundamental practices we engage in, is eating food for sustenance.
            How do we relate to food? What is true nourishment? What is sustenance?
            Understanding these deeper truths as well as healing our relationship with food is a master key to
            fully expressing our spiritual nature as a human being. It is a deeply healing part in our embodiment
            process. These principals are to be addressed and understood. They are calling for us to approach it
            with full consciousness, which is what this teaching brings to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This 6 week course you will dive into the art and science of nutrition. Learning the intricate
            relationship between food and our state of being. IxCacao is both a superfood and a Hand Maiden
            who will support you during your deep study of how the body works physically and energetically.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will learn the tools that will transform your daily food into
            medicine which can heal and unlock the hidden potentials within.
          </p>
          <p>
            The practices and information in this course are the building blocks to a personalised
            lifestyle that will support your needs in life. Additional to the primary teachings, is an
            optional offering of one-on-one sessions with Gabriel that will focus deeper on the specific
            practices and foods that harmonise with your unique constitution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, we will be exploring the sacredness of food through conscious ceremony/prayer.
            This is an important and forgotten nutrient that has a powerful impact on how we prepare and
            receive the medicine of our food.
